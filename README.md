# trove-lists

Trove lists and tags are created by Trove users to organise and describe resources. The details of public lists and tags are available through the Trove API. The notebooks in this repository demonstrate how to harvest and analyse list and tag data.

For more information and documentation see the [Trove lists and tags](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists) section of the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net).
