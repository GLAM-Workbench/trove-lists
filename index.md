# Trove lists and tags

* [**Convert a Trove list into a CSV file**](Convert-a-Trove-list-into-a-CSV-file.ipynb) – extracts list data from the Trove API and saves the results as CSV files (with separate files for newspaper articles and other resources); optionally save OCRd test, PDFs, and images of any listed newspaper articles.
* [**Harvest summary data from Trove lists**](Harvest-summary-data-from-lists.ipynb) – extract and analyse data from all public lists in Trove

### Tags

* [**Harvest public tags from Trove zones**](harvest-tags.ipynb) – assemble a dataset containing all public tags added to Trove
* [**Analyse public tags added to Trove**](analyse_tags.ipynb) – explore ways of analysing and visualising the complete dataset of public tags added to Trove resources
